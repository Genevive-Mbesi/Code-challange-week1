# Week1: Code Challange

## Learning goals

Testing the understanding of fundamentals in JavaScript

## Instructions

In this challenge we are given Toy problems to solve that will test our understanding of fundamentals in JavaScript which we covered this week in our Learning Management System. This challenge is valuable in evaluating if one is grasping the contents and where one needs to work and improve.

### Tests
We are given tasks to complete both as problems to be solved and tasks to be completed which are going to earn points depending on how well they are completed under a specific duration of time.

We use tests to determine if we are doing the right thing before submitting our work. Everyone is in charge of getting their tests to pass.
